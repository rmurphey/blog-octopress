[A post from Alex Russell](http://infrequently.org/2012/11/bits-and-remainders/) reminded me that I've given a number of talks in the last few months, and some of them even have video on the internet.

I've been ridiculously spoiled to get to travel all over the place these last few months -- San Francisco, New York, Amsterdam, Berlin, Brighton -- and speak at some truly first-class conferences, sharing the stage, sharing meals, and sharing beers with some seriously amazing folks. My [recent news](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/11/14/this-is-the-cup-of-coffee/) means I'll be doing a lot less travel for the next little bit, but I'm ever-so-grateful for the opportunities I've had and the people I've gotten to see and meet these last few months.

### JS Minty Fresh

A fun talk at [Fronteers](http://fronteers.nl/congres/2012) about eliminating code smells from your JavaScript. The best feedback I got afterwards was from an attendee who said they felt at the beginning of the talk like the material was going to be too basic for them, and by the end of the talk, the material was nearly over their head. "I guess that makes you a good teacher," he said. Aw!

### Beyond the DOM: Sane Structure for JS Apps

An update of my code organization talk, delivered at the [jQuery Conference in San Francisco](http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/). It's fun for me to see how my thinking around code organization has evolved and improved since my first, now-almost-embarassing talk at the 2009 jQuery Conference in Boston.

### Writing Testable JavaScript

This is the first talk I've developed that I've managed to give several times in rapid succession: three times in six days, including at [Full Frontal](http://2012.full-frontal.org/), the online [JS Summit](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/javascript-summit/), and to a group of developers at the New York Times. There's no video yet, but the [slides are here](https://speakerdeck.com/rmurphey/writing-testable-javascript-mocha-version), and there should be video soon, I think.

### Getting Better at JavaScript

I put this together as a quickie for the Berlin [UpFront](http://up.front.ug/) user group -- it was the first talk I gave with my broken foot, and the last talk I'd give for weeks because I lost my voice a couple of hours later. There's not a whole lot here, but it was a fun talk and a fun group, and a topic that I get plenty of questions about. Again, no video, but here are the slides:
