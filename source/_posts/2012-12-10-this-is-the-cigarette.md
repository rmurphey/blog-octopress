This is the cigarette I smoked* on Wednesday after I got out of a meeting in Boston and went to my desk and read my messages and learned that our birthmother "match" had fallen through.

The last three weeks have been among the happiest, most exciting, most terrifying times I can remember. Saying that we are sad and disappointed and et cetera doesn't really cover it, but, well, there it is. Our search will continue.
