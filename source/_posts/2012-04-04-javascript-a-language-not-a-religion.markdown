I have six things to say:

1. I am in a committed relationship with my partner Melissa. We will celebrate
   six years together on Sunday. We contribute frequently to political causes.

2. I was deeply saddened yesterday to learn that Brendan Eich contributed money
   in support of a [political initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8) that
   sought to *rescind the court-established right for same-sex couples to
   marry* in the state of California. It has changed my view of him as a
   person, despite the fact that we have had a positive and professional
   relationship and he has been a great supporter of my JavaScript career. I
   think he is on the wrong side of history, and I hope that courts will
   continue to agree with me.

3. I had a frank, private, and face-to-face conversation with Brendan about the
   issue during JSConf. I shared my disappointment, sadness, and disagreement.

4. I have been dismayed to see this incident interpreted as a statement about
   the JavaScript community as a whole. This community is made up of so many
   people who believe so many different things, and yesterday I was reminded
   that they are all just people, and JavaScript is just a language, not a
   religion.  I shudder to think of a world where there is a political litmus
   test for entry into the community.  Indeed, I am extremely torn about
   introducing personal politics into my professional life\*, as I fear it will
   encourage professional colleagues to opine about personal beliefs that are
   frankly none of their business. One of the great joys of working with
   computers is that they [do not care who I am or what I believe](http://raganwald.posterous.com/a-womans-story);
   I realize that to ask the same of people is unreasonable, but inviting
   politics into the workplace is a treacherously slippery slope. Unless my
   personal belief system presents an *imminent danger* to my colleagues, I am
   loath to welcome discussion of it by people who otherwise have no
   substantial or personal relationship with me.

5. I believe individual companies must determine how best to address these
   issues, as their attitude toward them can have a significant impact on their
   ability to hire and retain talented people. I support *constructive
   pressure* on companies to align themselves with or distance themselves from
   political causes, but I would not support a company that prohibited its
   employees from participating in the political process. I urge anyone who is
   hurt or offended by this incident to engage with Brendan and Mozilla
   personally and professionally. Brendan is wrong on this issue, but he is a
   thoughtful and intelligent person, and he is also a human being.

6. Finally: If this incident has made you angry or sad or disappointed, the most effective
   thing you can do is follow in Brendan's footsteps by **putting your money
   where your mouth is**. Money speaks volumes in the American political
   system, and there are campaigns in progress right now that will [impact the rights of gays and lesbians](http://www.protectncfamilies.org/).
   Your [contribution](https://protectallncfamilies.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute)
   of $50, $100, or $1,000 -- or, in lieu of money, your time -- will have far
   more impact than yet another angry tweet.

And now I shall turn off the internet for a bit. Comments are disabled.
Shocker, I know.

\* *It bears mentioning that, in certain cases, people making political
contributions are required to include information about their employer. The
inclusion of this information does not indicate that the employer supports --
or is even aware of -- the contribution.*
